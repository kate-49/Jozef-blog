    <h2> First, there was magic! </h2>
    <h3> Darkness has been their home, their prison, for weeks now. </h3>
    <p> Ten people per oar, thirty five oars on either side. Pitch blackness, save a flash of dusty blue light when scant food was magicked to the deck’s floor. As far as anyone knew, they would die here, as galley slaves sealed in a ship that was built around them in docks of an unknown harbor. Captives to entities unseen and mostly unheard for the length of this horrific journey. </p>
    <p> They were told, by a baleful growl from within the darkness, to row. Dozens had died rowing, their limp bodies still manacled to the seat and oar that their comrades in chains now had to bear, all the harder for the extra weight now slumped over the wood. It seemed to claim not the weakest or the most fatigued, but those least prepared mentally for the pointless, mindless struggle to keep pace without progress or destination in sight. Those who begged for release loudest were often the first to have their bodies acquiesce. </p>
    <p> Those still alive seemed to have something to live for, or at the least, a reason not to embrace a death that seemed all but inevitable. </p>
    <p> One of those individuals, a shaman of Keinikka in the far North-East, began each period of rowing (following the brief interlude when the food was sent) by proclaiming his creed, in a sonorous voice that seemed out of place, coming from a spindly and haggard frame. His eyes, if any could see them in the absolute blackness of the sealed-up rowing deck, milked over as he recited his sacrament, becoming two perfect white spheres embedded in sunken sockets while he spoke: <p>
    <p class="italics"> First, there was Magic. Then there was consciousness. Then came Law. Law of Space, Time, Presence and Governance. Consciousness used Law, and by its wielding enthralled Reason, casting out the madness and anarchy of Magic. Law cannot tame Magic, Consciousness cannot truly know it, but by all three powers do we navigate through the- <p>
    <p> This time he stopped, as if interrupted. The deck’s inhabitants were silent, as they ever were when the old man began his missive, grateful for the reminder of other living beings experiencing this torment alongside them. No interruption was heard, but one powerfully built Dwarven Cleric guessed at its portent and chuckled loudly: </p>
    <p class="italics"> Don’ you worry now, frien’s! That there was the firs’ sign of ma frien’s up above makin’ their move, and we’ll be righ’ out in but a wee momen’!</p>
    <p> The dwarf’s confidence shocked the closest four rowers nearby. He had been silent the entire journey, not even venturing a whisper of introduction as the blended days and nights bled by. It was as if he’d appeared out of nowhere to make this proclamation. </p>
    <p> Indeed, Chekov Harverey, Drow Elf of the Underdark, turned Cleric of War - before being captured, of course - had infravision, a genetic gift that allowed him to see heat when no light was present, and couldn’t remember seeing the Dwarf sitting where he was now. In fact, Chekov was fairly certain the Dwarf wasn’t even chained up… </p>
    <p class="italics"> What are you talking about?! We’re trapped in this fucking boat and we’re gonna die down here! </p>
    <p> Morwenna Krag, a waif of a girl with matted, greasy hair covering her grimy face, now sodden with tears, had no hope to share with this Dwarven cheerleader. Strong for her age - too strong at times, with no discernible root from which such power ought to come -  yet still a child, she knew that nothing but a miracle would see her escaping this hole with her life. </p>
    <p class="italics"> Wait, let him talk, maybe he knows something. You, Dwarf, what do you mean your ‘friends’? </p>
    <p> The words directed at the Cleric were spat out, as if the speaking were bitter-tasting in Ampersand Seafuss’ mouth. an Elf by birth, though raised by Dwarves, he had no love for the race that had both killed his parents and taken him in. As he saw it, they had used him as a curio while divvying up the spoils from the conquest of his birthright and true home. It stung to admit it, but Ampersand knew this Dwarf could be useful, and if it meant freedom and a life outside this wooden cage, he would swallow the bile that came up from such a reliance on her enemy. </p>
    <p class="italics"> Le’s jus’ say, ma pals up on the surface are makin’ waves of the kind this ship won’ much like. The kind tha’ may well provide a way for you all to escape, so be ready, alrigh’? They won’ much worry if you’re out or no’, so get topside as quick as you like. And tell ‘em Wotan sent ye! </p>
    <p> Wotan gave another hearty chuckle as he stretched his fingers out in front of him, as if preparing for some form of exertion. As he was speaking, a low moan began growing in volume from the back of the deck, reaching a near-shout by the time Wotan was finished. It was the Keinikkian Shaman, who was now in full voice and wailing a single, deep pitched note at an unsettling volume and without taking a breath. Chekov looked back to the Shaman, studying his posture and visage: </p>
    <p class="italics"> I think he’s possessed? There’s something terrible about to happen. Possession is rarely good. </p>
    <p> Wotan’s head jerked suddenly, as if someone far-off had called his name: </p>
    <p class="italics"> Alrigh’, this is it team! I’ll see you topside. Remember, Time an’ tide wait for no slave! </p>
    <p> A massive percussive thud knocked the wind from everyone’s lungs - though the wailing continued unabated - as the larboard side of the ship was struck, then punctured, by a huge knurled and dented wooden rod, wrapped in bands of dull metal and attached to the front end of what looked to be a giant, amber-colored ship. The shocked slaves only knew it was amber in color because the rod tore through the deck, lurched to the left and ripped the bow of the ship clean away, exposing the deck to the blinding Sun - and a torrent of briny, foamy water.</p>
