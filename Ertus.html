    <h3> Darkness has been their home, their prison, for weeks now. </h3>
    <p> Ten people per oar, thirty five oars on either side. Pitch blackness, save a flash of dusty blue light when scant food was magicked to the deckâ€™s floor. As far as anyone knew, they would die here, as galley slaves sealed in a ship that was built around them in docks of an unknown harbor. Captives to entities unseen and mostly unheard for the length of this horrific journey. </p>
