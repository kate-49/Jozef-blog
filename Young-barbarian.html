    <h2> Hello, Diary! </h2>
    <p> This is Corwen. Ramas told me that all great warriors across the lands have tales told of them, and many scribes and bards like to lie and twist the truth to suit their own causes, so I’m writing my deeds down, so nobody can twist my story into something it’s not. (Also, Dad always says great men can read, write, concede and fight. This will help with the first two I think)Today is the day after Vin’s birthday. He is 20 now. Me being the youngest, I gave him his first present - a new sling I made myself. He already had one but was boring the beetles off the bark with his complaining on how old and mouldy it was. He liked it a lot I think, and when he tried it out he hit a bird off a branch with his third or fourth try! So it must work better than his old one, since he couldn’t hit a damn thing before. I’ll be 15 soon, maybe in a month or two. Mum thinks I can take the rite of the woods now, no problem, and I agree but the rules are the rules. I wouldn’t impress nobody coming back even with the biggest straightoak in the wood if I did it too soon. Ramas and Orel both want to take me to see the goliaths for my birthday. Orel says he’s talked with them before but I think he’s lying - trying to impress Ramas and scare me. I know Ramas met with them though, he traded the handaxe he made for a big thick dagger one of them had. He let me hold it once, it’s so heavy I think I’d do more damage lobbing it at someone than trying to stick them with it. The goliath folk must really be as big and strong as they say. I guess I’ll see soon enough. Okay Diary, my hand is tired now. Go in health, and open to no-one but your author! CB. </p>

    <h2> Corwen's Journal #2 </h2>
    <p> Hello Diary, Tomorrow is the day I become a man! I doubt I will sleep tonight, I can feel my muscles tensing at the ready for the task ahead. I scouted the tree I want last week, it’s the one on the far side of hunter’s glade, you can see it poking up from the clearing. But not for long! I spoke to Orel about how best to start. He says dig up the earth around the sides of the tree and cut into the very bottom. He said leaving too much of a stump means you’ll have less to show when you get it back to town. I told him that won’t be a problem, since I’m going for a Giant one. He seemed scared of the idea, like he was worried I’d fail. I don’t know how he and me are related sometimes. I got my axe and saw sharpened at Dren’s hut already. He wished me well and did the work for free, but I told him I’d bring him an elk as thanks for the generosity (Ramas brought him a goat when he did the rite so I had to promise the elk). Dren is a good man but old, and very happy at his age. Like he thinks it’s a point of pride to never risk his neck for his home or kin. I suppose I should be grateful soft people live in Hillfog. I can’t do nearly as good a job on the whetstones as Dren. I made sure to go and pray with Dad and Ramas this morning, too. The elders’ hut was open early so we gave our offerings directly to Salen and Tremm. They told us about the history of the rite, for the 1000’th time I’m sure, and said I should be careful with my saws. The weather recently has left bark dry as Hoven’s Jerky and as flammable as Fran’s firemarsh mash. If a spark gets up out of my saw blade it’ll catch the whole wood alight, so I have to make sure my waterskin’s full and ready to cool the saw. I think I’ll grab a sack of creosote too - it’s not too heavy and Vin said he saw the Goliaths making a fire trench last summer the same way we do, but with creosote burns across the trees as well as the grass. Better prepared and tired than relaxed and aflame! Anyway, that’s tomorrow’s task. I should try and sleep now, elsewise I’ll be shopping for candles instead of felling trees. Go in health, Diary.
