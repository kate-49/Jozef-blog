      <h1> Diary of a young barbarian </h1>
    </div>

    <div class="color1">
      <h2> Hello, Diary! </h2>
      <p> This is Corwen. Ramas told me that all great warriors across the lands have tales told of them, and many scribes and bards like to lie and twist the truth to suit their own causes, so I’m writing my deeds down, so nobody can twist my story into something it’s not. (Also, Dad always says great men can read, write, concede and fight. </p>
      <br>
      <p> This will help with the first two I think)Today is the day after Vin’s birthday. He is 20 now. Me being the youngest, I gave him his first present - a new sling I made myself. He already had one but was boring the beetles off the bark with his complaining on how old and mouldy it was. He liked it a lot I think, and when he tried it out he hit a bird off a branch with his third or fourth try! So it must work better than his old one, since he couldn’t hit a damn thing before. </p>
      <br>
      <p> I’ll be 15 soon, maybe in a month or two. Mum thinks I can take the rite of the woods now, no problem, and I agree but the rules are the rules. I wouldn’t impress nobody coming back even with the biggest straightoak in the wood if I did it too soon. </p>
      <br>
      <p> Ramas and Orel both want to take me to see the goliaths for my birthday. Orel says he’s talked with them before but I think he’s lying - trying to impress Ramas and scare me. I know Ramas met with them though, he traded the handaxe he made for a big thick dagger one of them had. He let me hold it once, it’s so heavy I think I’d do more damage lobbing it at someone than trying to stick them with it. The goliath folk must really be as big and strong as they say. I guess I’ll see soon enough. </p>
      <br>
      <p> Okay Diary, my hand is tired now. Go in health, and open to no-one but your author! </p>

      <h2> Corwen's Journal #2 </h2>
      <p> Hello Diary, </p>
      <br>
      <p> Tomorrow is the day I become a man! I doubt I will sleep tonight, I can feel my muscles tensing at the ready for the task ahead. I scouted the tree I want last week, it’s the one on the far side of hunter’s glade, you can see it poking up from the clearing. But not for long! </p>
      <br>
      <p> I spoke to Orel about how best to start. He says dig up the earth around the sides of the tree and cut into the very bottom. He said leaving too much of a stump means you’ll have less to show when you get it back to town. I told him that won’t be a problem, since I’m going for a Giant one. He seemed scared of the idea, like he was worried I’d fail. I don’t know how he and me are related sometimes. </p>
      <br>
      <p> I got my axe and saw sharpened at Dren’s hut already. He wished me well and did the work for free, but I told him I’d bring him an elk as thanks for the generosity (Ramas brought him a goat when he did the rite so I had to promise the elk). Dren is a good man but old, and very happy at his age. Like he thinks it’s a point of pride to never risk his neck for his home or kin. I suppose I should be grateful soft people live in Hillfog. I can’t do nearly as good a job on the whetstones as Dren. </p>
      <br>
      <p> I made sure to go and pray with Dad and Ramas this morning, too. The elders’ hut was open early so we gave our offerings directly to Salen and Tremm. They told us about the history of the rite, for the 1000’th time I’m sure, and said I should be careful with my saws. The weather recently has left bark dry as Hoven’s Jerky and as flammable as Fran’s firemarsh mash. If a spark gets up out of my saw blade it’ll catch the whole wood alight, so I have to make sure my waterskin’s full and ready to cool the saw. I think I’ll grab a sack of creosote too - it’s not too heavy and Vin said he saw the Goliaths making a fire trench last summer the same way we do, but with creosote burns across the trees as well as the grass. Better prepared and tired than relaxed and aflame! </p>
      <br>
      <p> Anyway, that’s tomorrow’s task. I should try and sleep now, elsewise I’ll be shopping for candles instead of felling trees. </p>
      <br>
      <p> Go in health, Diary. </p>

      <h2> Corwen's Journal #3 </h2>
      <p> Diary, </p>
      <br>
      <p> I doubt I’ll forget this day for as long as I draw breath, but for the benefit of bards and scribes that want to tell my tale in future times, I’ll write it down. </p>
      <br>
      <p> A month ago was my rite of the woods. This means, by Hillfog tradition, a child of 16 must set out before dawn to fell a tree. The size of the tree is important, since the child must bring it back to town alone and unaided, and cut it down to firewood for their family. The bigger the tree, the more firewood, and it’s said that the family will be blessed with luck and bounty for as long as the rite of the wood’s fuel is burning in their hearth. If a child fails to bring the tree home unaided by day’s end, or can’t fell the tree alone, they are said to have remained a babe, and must try again in a year’s time. (this is a shame that has never befallen a Blackleaf and rarely happens at all, but it was a fear that nibbled at me on the night before) </p>
      <br>
      <p> I had already chosen the Straightoak I wanted to fell, a giant and proud beast of wood that would take me the better part of the morning to fell, and the majority of the afternoon to drag home with my dad’s harness, so I knew where I was going when I awoke. By the time I made it to the glade the sun was hinting at its intent but there was a glow to the north that rivaled the coming dawn. At first I thought I had somehow got turned around, but the smell on the air carried ash and fumes from a fire, just like the Elders warned. I ran past my tree to see what damage had been done, and if i could stop the fire’s spread. It was a good distance away, and I soon realised I had passed into Goliath territory on the way to the blaze. The air was getting thick with soot and the forest was reacting to the danger - elk and squirrel raced in the opposite direction to the one I traveled, rodents and snakes traveled together in the undergrowth to escape the heat. I even saw a bear, brown fur painted black and grey by the scorches and ash, lumber its way down and away. But eventually, After an hour or so of running, I saw the forest fire in its majesty and power. It had already burned through five or six furlongs, from the view I had atop a tree I climbed to see the lay of the land. </p>
      <br>
      <p> I knew the creosote was the only way to stop the spread - no amount of water would quench the blaze. So I raced back a ways, to give me time to climb the biggest of the trees about, strip their branches facing the fire and smear the bark with the tar. As I moved back to the line I had drawn in my head, I saw the trees around marked with white circles. These marked trees showed the path of the Goliaths - it was their way, we knew, of making paths through the woods without destroying the woods themselves. Follow the markings and you’ll get where you’re going, was the idea. I had ran back to the path of the Goliaths, which meant the fire was dangerously close to a Goliath den already. With the lives of these people on the line I raced up and down the Straightoaks with a pace and drive I didn’t know I had, stripping branches, smearing creosote and bundling the fallen leaves as best I could away from the flames. As I climbed another in the line, I saw on the ground a group of 6 or 7 Goliath men doing the same as me, further back into the wood but just as fast as I was moving. With their work and mine combined, we made a perimeter along the edge of their den and, when the flames hit the tar a great flash of heat and light shot up from the trees, searing the bark and leaving a protective layer of burned-up fuel. Having nothing left to eat, the fire raged against our wall for some time more before retreating elsewhere. </p>
      <br>
      <p> It was during this time of vigilance I approached the Goliath group I had seen, wary of them but also thankful of their aid. It turned out they felt the same toward me, thinking I was a child-scout from a neighbouring tribe. I explained as best I could why I was here, and they quickly understood, with hearty laughs and pats on my back that pushed me into the soft ground beneath our feet. They wished me well on the rite (that I had forgotten completely) and bid me join them in their den when my rite was done. </p>
      <br>
      <p> I felled the tree just after noon, a handful of hours spent in sweat and burning muscles and a kind of determined misery that fell away as the tree did the same, leaving in its place a kind of pride and acceptance - pride in my work, and acceptance that more work was yet to go. I put on Obert’s harness, made for a man that I was yet to be, and hitched the log to it. And then I walked. </p>
      <br>
      <p> It was easily 5 miles of flat forest and a half mile of hills before I reached the slope that led down to Hillfog. I crested that hill just as the Sun was setting and didn’t reach the town until well after nightfall. But I made it, and the tree was unhitched from me as the town threw me onto its shoulders, celebrating my work and my rite’s completion. My mother was singing as my dad cried softly into his fiddle, smiling all the while. My brothers led me into Fran’s Furnace, Hillfog’s famous tavern, and gave me so many meads and Firemarsh mash that I could barely hold my head off the table, but I was too proud and happy to refuse any folk’s generosity that night. </p>
      <br>
      <p> Come morning (or rather, noon) the next day I was awoken by my body and its whines and complaints, but also by the memory of the Goliaths and their request for me to see them again. Now a man, I had but a handful of days to choose a home of my own and Ramas had already promised to help me in the plotting of my land at the town’s edge, but I told him of my appointment and he was willing to wait, though he knew the dangers of dealing with folk from abroad. </p>
      <br>
      <p> I returned to the den with a clearer head but a weaker body than I hoped and cursed myself for the drink I had taken so willingly. But arrive I did, and met with the Goliaths that helped in the line against the forest fire. They told me their names and said that without my work, many expected the fire to overrun their den. I told them it was an honour to help those who share the land, and thanked them for protecting it as I tried to. This pleased them all a great deal, and they took me to see their leader, a huge, huge man of naught but muscle, scars and fearsome tattoos. He spoke in a voice that seemed closer to a growl than words, but I made out that he wanted to give me a name. Names carry great value to Goliaths, he said, and the sharing of a name means a bond is made. The giving of a name is a boon and powerful gift, and so he gifted me the name Treekeeper. I was overjoyed, but seeing the mood of the other Goliaths was somber and serious, I thanked the giant man calmly and with respect. </p>
      <br>
      <p> Then I found out how Goliath tattoos are given. </p>
      <br>
      <p> I left the den of the Kolakatake Goliaths more of a man than my father, or the elders of Hillfog. With the tattoo had come a strange power that I have yet to fully understand, and the knowledge that this power exists in the wild places of the world as well as in its civilisation. The Kolakatake taught me about the strength imbued to the body when its limits are reached, and how they trained to use this strength. I stayed with them for 3 weeks, and in that time became a child again, learning how to walk among adults that could toss boulders aside and jump across raging rivers. I learned what it meant to live in nature, not just alongside it, and I was taught to revere animals as though they were my kin. Because, as the Leader Gan Rocrider Kolakatake said, they were my kin, and all animals, men and Goliaths alike are fighting with, against and for Nature every day they live. That is why, now I am home, I can’t stay. There is no fight in Hillfog, no risk in building a house with my brother and working alongside my father. Besides a raiding party lost in the forest we never see battle, and so our fur grows grey and our claws grow dull. The fight leaves us and if a true fire were to rise, we would be as leaves from a felled tree - kindling to fuel a power beyond our control. </p>
      <br>
      <p> I have packed, and say my goodbyes tomorrow at first light. </p>

      <h2> PERSONNEL REPORT: INFANTRYMAN BLACKLEAF, CORWEN ISAIAH </h2>
      <br>
      <p> Corwen Blackleaf: 20 years old (doesn't know precisely when) human male, potential cross-breeding with Goliath elements in recent ancestry. </p>
      <br>
      <p> 6 foot 8 tall (though with poor posture unless excited or anxious, which is rare.) </p>
      <br>
      <p> 119kg. </p>
      <br>
      <p> 58 inch chest, 19 inch neck, 36 inch waist, 27 inch thighs. NOTE: Infantryman garb WILL need to be adjusted for Blackleaf; allowing him to self-adjust leads to a ruined standard uniform. </p>
      <br>
      <h3> HISTORY AND EVALUATION </h3>
      <br>
      <p> Blackleaf describes his growing-up in a small lumber town in Imperial Munsk, (Hillfog) to a woodsman father (Obert) and herbalist mother (Rowan) , both of whom raised him as the youngest of 4 boys (Orel, Vin and Ramas, deceased all) until, in accordance with tradition in Hillfog, Blackleaf was sent to the forest to fell the tallest tree he could manage, bringing it home for the family hearth. Blackleaf takes great pride in describing the size and girth of the straightoak tree he chose to fell. </p>
      <br>
      <p> During this rite, Blackleaf saw what he took to be a forest fire far into the forest, and noted it as being unusual for the time of year and climate. He went to inspect, discovering the vastness of the blaze and its directionality. Blackleaf recounts with solemnity the corpses of local fauna and the risk of further mortality if the fire were to remain unchecked. Also noted was the risk to a semi-nomadic clan of Goliath, known by Blackleaf as the Kolak'atake, as the fire threatened to raze what settlements the creatures had established thus far if allowed to progress. </p>
      <br>
      <p> Blackleaf recalls removing an amount of creosote from his pack, making haste around the blaze and climbing some number of straightoaks, stripping what branches he could and smearing the creosote along the timber, effectively inuring the wood to fire damage once the tar mixture had burned through. The act was seen by a number of Goliath, who somehow communicated this act to others. Blackleaf asserts the elder Goliath then gave him the name "Treekeeper" and gave the order to tattoo the symbol of a tree on Blackleaf's right leg. The tattoo itself is documented as being performed with some skill and medical awareness, but Blackleaf insists the Goliath were the ones who performed the act (the location of the tattoo means it is unnoticed when Blackleaf is in infantry garb). </p>
      <br>
      <p> Blackleaf returned home, in his account, some weeks later with a great reverence and respect for Goliath life, and claims he sought out "wisdom and traditions" from their way of life with Hillfog's elder community. Naturally they counselled strongly against this line of enquiry, which has had the unfortunate side effect of fuelling Blackleaf's belief in his own Goliath ancestry (which, admittedly, would go some way to explain his size, strength and lack of intellect) </p>
      <br>
      <p> Blackleaf recounts his leaving Hillfog for work some years later, acting varyingly as guide, hunter, tracker and sometime bounty hunter. it was around this point, Blackleaf notes, that his record is marred by an unfortunate incident at the Rheille Estate, whereupon he unwittingly assisted a burglary, under the impression the criminal element were in fact the owners of the estate. The bandits escaped with virtually all of Duke and Lady Rheille's small valuables and Blackleaf was flogged, pilloried and eventually ran out of town for his error. He notes vehemently that he learned many lessons that day, none of which leave his mind when dealing with criminals, townsfolk or the nobility. </p>
      <br>
      <p> Blackleaf came to join Kazimir's Own after a time of wandering indolence following the above incident, citing a lack of direction and "shame for myself, my name, my families (here he makes mention of a sense of having a home both among the Goliath and his true home in Hillfog), and my brothers' memories". Blackleaf here notes that his brothers all were successful tradesmen and loggers, though each of whom perished. He doesn't know details, save for the eldest, Ramas, having business connections in the far south that "all who knew, knew better than to talk about". Blackleaf naturally suspects foul play, but has expressed no desire for vengeance. </p>
      <br>
       <h3> EVALUATION: </h3>
      <br>
      <p> Blackleaf is well liked among his peers in the junior regiment, with a reputation for enthralling stories and an iron liver. an excellent impersonator, his record among KO is smattered with reprimands from his superiors who objected to his renditions of their orders being mimicked so precisely. He has been issued warnings for excessive ration consumption and abuse of uniform, but has no misconduct markings to speak of. In battle he is often the first to the field, with a bravery and willingness to engage that has been noted as being inspiring among the less confident comrades in arms. In addition, he has received commendations for repeatedly evacuating fallen comrades from the front to receive medical aid before returning himself to the battle, often without anyone missing him for any length of time. To progress his career in KO Blackleaf will need to assert himself more as a thinker of some kind, as well as an awareness of the wider causes and potential solutions to skirmishes and battles besides pure attrition. Finally, a willingness to accept a loss, however small, must be imparted to him if he is to grow as an effective soldier. As it stands his bravery and self-confidence has carried him through, but no leader of men can be trusted to lead after a defeat if he has not yet tasted it. </p>

      <h2> MY APPLICATION, BY CORWEN I. BLACKLEAF </h2>
      <br>
      <p> Hello to you, Allocations Officer. I am writing this application to apply to join the squad under the command of Sergeant Thoralf Rasczak. I am hoping to work under this sergeant because he has been an inspiration to me since I was a pup out in Hillfog and he knew the hero Kazimir himself, which is a big inspiration for me too. Big Raz Sergeant Rasczak is the man that expects all of us to be the best we can be, and will not accept anything less. I feel the same way and want to do my best to show him my quality, as well as perform the duties he gives out to the best of my ability. </p>
      <br>
      <h3> WHY I SHOULD GET THE JOB </h3>
      <br>
      <p> I am the right fit for this squad because I am strong, fast, loyal and determined and <strike> compasionnat </strike> friendly. I let the <strike> puny </strike> less physical troops do their bit and am a big team player, placing myself where I can do the most <strike> damage good </strike> damage for the squad’s goals. I have aspirations like any junior trooper - win commendations and medals, rise in ranks, lead a banner of my own one day - and these can only happen when I work for the best sarge there is. Rasczak may not think of himself that way but we all do, ask anyone and they’ll tell you straight away.  </p>
      <br>
      <h3> WHY I DEFINITELY SHOULD NOT GET SENT TO SERGEANT DANCER </h3>
      <br>
      <p> I have included this part at the request of my comrade and friend, Junior infantryman Nels Stroppe who was allocated recently to Sergeant Garen Dancer. Nels thinks I would be a bad fit for that clown parade squad because of a few reasons but mainly Dancer is incapable of protecting his boys and girls and they all died last trek because of him and his cowardice and his fetish for sucking on gold pieces like they was each one his mistress. Please understand, I am certain Dancer is a squad leader and Sergeant for a reason, and that reason is probably seen by lots of folk as a good one, but if I was to work under him I feel we may fall to discussing the right way to stow our breadknives, and one of us may have to give a demonstration at the other. <strike> I could do it with a spoon too, he’s so soft </strike>  Meaning no disrespect or second-guessing your decisions now or in the past.  </p>
      <br>
      <h3> WHAT POSITION I WOULD BE GOOD AT </h3>
      <br>
      <p> Like Big Raz, I am the man to throw in the front and make breaks through the enemy lines. Point Lead or Scout would be the best pick for me I think. I would also do well as 1st Corporal to the sarge himself, which I think is the job where he tells me what he wants the squad to do then I make it happen with the squad, kind of like the 2nd in command? I would do well in this role because Sergeant Rasczak and me would see eye to eye on a lot of things and he could teach me all about war tactics and the best way to chase down retreats and things of that sort, and I would do better than any other in this role thanks to the strength and determination I mentioned but also, I am a great listener and know the difference between big crossbows and small ballistas so he wouldn’t be wasting his breath on some green junior holding his dagger backwards on his first day. </p>
      <br>
      <h3> CONCLUSION </h3>
      <br>
      <p> If it pleases the Allocations Officer I am willing to do a test of strength against any other junior comrade in order to see who deserves this spot - I will even let them choose what test it should be! Like I said before, friendly, and determined.  </p>
      <br>
      <p> Thank you for reading my application.  </p>
      <br>
      <p> Yours in health and good fettle, </p>

      <h2> Corwen's Journal #4 </h2>
      <p> Torsday, 13th of Emer. 1304 (kaz’s deathday.) </p>
      <p> Diary, </p>
      <p> Met up with my comrades today, after traveling (afoot, the whole way…) to an outpost in Munsk. It was me and Dodd (Dodd is a little man, bit on the nervous side but otherwise OK) just waiting at the 3 Trees until the rest of this new squad arrived. We were forming up under a new sarge - Thoralf Rasczak, thank the gods, though I didn’t know it then - and I was trying to look calm, though Dodd kept asking if I wanted food and drink, as if stuffing my face would be a good first impression for any new recruit to make.  </p>
      <p> Eventually Astrid, Torch and Peppercorn joined us. They all have a look about them that makes me feel this squad is going to do real well. Torch is Torch, we all know her - fierce and independent. She summoned some kind of magic eagle in the middle of the 3 Trees, nearly knocked Dodd over with shock! Astrid seems real reliable, and her armour’s immaculate - that’s the sign of a quality ranker. Peppercorn is… well, I think she’s a fairy? Like the gods of the forest that the Elders used to look for and give offerings to? Unless she’s like a different kind of fairy, or the fairies we have back home are more powerful… I guess we’ll see. Working alongside a god as my first commission is a pretty big step up from carrying around sacks and boxes in the juniors! </p>

      <p> Diary, </p>
      <p> We got our assignment - kill some wolves that nabbed this guy’s maid, then head to Mud, to the greenchain docks. I did my best trying to track the beasts but the domestic wildlife out here are thick as the muck they wallow in. Found a bunch of the wolves, took their paws as proof and went back to the 3 Trees to provide the evidence and the fucking poxy barman threw a fit, shouted guff about not wanting bloody paws on his bartop. But clearly he was fine and smiley about the bloody tracks his patron’s maid left out in the street? I swear the closer we get to ‘Civilisation’ the worse folk get.  </p>
      <p> We’re off on the road now, will update when I get the chance. </p>

      <h2> Corwen's Journal #6 </h2>
      <p> Diary, </p>
      <p> We got to Mud and had a run-in with the redguards. As if this city weren’t bad enough. It’s like the cesspit of the floating city above, and the chains that connect the two feel more like manacles keeping the people down here from running off, not that they have the energy to escape. Anyway, The reds outnumbered us and had us surrounded in an alley, I was lucky I had such strong comrades about me otherwise I don’t think I would have made it. Three of them took me down pretty quick, all I remember hearing was shouting and running, then Astrid and Pepper were helping me up, and Torch was tending to Dodd who was in a bad way also. I’ll say it again, we’re lucky to have such quality rankers with us. I was mortified about being a burden though, and the squad could see it, I’m sure. I rarely hit the deck, and falling in a fight just before seeing Thoralf is humiliating to say the least of it. If I lose my commission for this I don’t know what I’ll do. </p>

      <h2> Corwen's Journal #7 </h2>
      <p> Diary, </p>
      <p> Met the Sarge. He ribbed me and Dodd something awful about the scuffle in the alley, I thought I was going to throw up, such was my shame for it. Dodd got the worst of it - Sarge called him a coward, kept on at him about how he ran away, though Dodd said he went to get a vantage point up high. I trust Dodd and his tactics, but Rasczak really hammered it into him about “No retreats, nobody quits”. I think Dodd’s okay though - seemed more upset by his wounds than the words. Luckily we’re all still in the squad, and the Sarge is getting us to unload a ship onto his cart. Says we’re headed north, to the mountains or thereabouts. Have to say I’ll be glad leaving the city after this. At least in the wilds nature cleans up after itself, with bugs and corpse eaters and the like. Here decay and filth seems baked into the huts and hovels all about, and being so close to ‘Civilisation’ above on the floating city is like holding a torch near a swamp - you just don’t want to know what you’re wading through. </p>

      <p> We’ve been travelling afoot alongside Sarge’s cart for a few days, camping aside the road. Thoralf sleeps like being awake is offensive to him, hits the sack hard and fast. I envy that. Always struggled to get to bed, specially when out in the open. Astrid struggled to find us a defensible spot the first night but we were more lucky after that. Sarge says we’re near to a town, says we’re stopping at a tavern he knows.

      <p> Diary, </p>
      <p> Dodd and me are guarding the cart as the rankers and Sarge are refreshing themselves in the Boar’s head, the tavern the Sarge knew about. Seems like a nice place from the outside, and the town isn’t dirty or overrun. Dodd’s a bit jumpy, had to remind him of the mission a couple of times already. Hope he calms down and focuses on the mission at hand. </p>

      <p> So a bloke ran by us wielding something sharp - for some reason Dodd engaged and asked what was up. Turns out the guy’s lost family and suspects goblins. He’s looking for assistance, though I reminded Dodd we already have a mission. Told him to check with Roughneck, so he’s gone into the tavern to do so. Again, had to remind Dodd what we’re here for. </p>

      <p> Roughneck reckons we ought to help this chap Lars find his kid, so we’re off to hunt gobbos. wish us luck, though a handful of maggoty imps shouldn’t be too much of a challenge. Roughneck’s put Peppercorn in charge (I think it’s a test) so she’s on point. I can feel Torch’s jaw clenching from here. </p>

      <p> Halsday, 19th Emer </p>
      <p> Diary, </p>
      <p> Torch has, without a doubt, just saved my life and the life of Bessie, the girl we were sent to retrieve.  </p>
      <p> We tracked the gobbos through forests and fields back to some kind of abandoned encampment, with heads on spikes and mystic looking guff on walls strewn about. One thing stood out that Astrid and Peppercorn mentioned: The markings on the walls in one hut seemed to match the carving on the anvil that Lars - the blacksmith who lost Bessie - has in his place. Maybe the gobbos wanted revenge for him knicking ‘their’ stuff? Didn’t stop to ask them - we took most of them by surprise and made our way into a tunnelworks that was pretty well guarded (Peppercorn decided it must be a lair of some kind, which is where they’d likely stow Bessie)  </p>
      <p> Peppercorn was right, and led us through the tunnelworks where Dodd dispatched half a room of gobbos before anyone else could get a look-in! I stopped to collect the vermin’s ears (they were up as bounty for some baron, hopefully he’s good for the cash since I’ve over 30 ears in my sack) and awaited Peppercorn’s signal to proceed. </p>
      <p> When we moved into the next chamber, we all saw Bessie, caged and unconscious, in the far corner. To get to her we needed to dice up what looked like a goat-man? some kind of blasted mage I guessed, nothing Kazimir’s Own needed to worry about at any rate. the ex-goat-man had friends though, and after slogging through a full day and night’s pursuit and multiple assaults, we were feeling every clang of shield and sword and spell. </p>
      <p> Thanks to some perfectly timed healing from Astrid and some patented Dodd “knife in the neck” maneuvers, we got to Bessie before any other nastiness could descend. </p>
      <p> That’s when, to my mind, we ought to have left. A lot of scribbles about the place seemed to suggest we were in a crypt (for humans, not gobbos) and places like that harbour spirits that deserve their rest. Peppercorn decided we ought to fully survey the area though, so we did, and discovered sarcophagi. 7 of them, I think. </p>
      <p> Now you know me, I follow orders to the letter and am usually happy to have been ordered in the first place. But when Peppercorn said we should open a sarcophagus up, I was less than jumping at the chance. My doubts weren’t noted though (at least, I hope it wasn’t) even though opening this sacred space up for the world to peer in did prove, in my humble opinion, to be a misstep. </p>
      <p> Skeleton warriors burst up from all of the sarcophagi and attacked us, fierce and brave even in death. They proved powerful enough to force us back out of their antechamber and back into the main ‘ritual space’ where goatboy used to be. After being speared something awful I saw white for a few seconds but Dodd patched me up and got me on my feet in time to see Astrid and Peppercorn finish off the remaining warriors.  </p>
      <p> After that, for some reason the squad fell about looting the dead? I didn’t ask questions, perhaps Peppercorn and Astrid know of some reason why graverobbing is acceptable when the dead return to fight first? Anyway, we picked up some swords and armour that look of good quality. Someone was talking about how the steel was unnaturally cold, as though skeleton warriors nearly gutting us were a sideshow for the real delight that was chilly blades - I chalked it up to exhaustion and got on with the business of cleaning Canopy off from all the gobbo blood she’d been steeped in.  </p>
      <p> A while after this, we each heard the sounds of small footsteps coming from the passage that led out and away from the chamber - We’d tarried too long and allowed ourselves to be trapped in the lair of what seemed to be a larger goblin settlement that we realised. I steeled myself again for another round, perhaps the last round, but after a roaring fireblast incinerated the approaching mob we saw Torch arrive in the doorway, a hero after Kazimir’s own image!  </p>
      <p> She’d been sent to bring us back, after we’d been gone for so long. And by all the gods, I am thankful Roughneck saw fit to send her. We’re making ready to head homeward with Bessie now, and having a full squad is the only way we’ll be able to make it back with our quarry.  </p>

      <p> Diary, </p>
      <p> We’re just taking a breather, walking back through this forest with Bessie and the gear from the skeleton warriors is taking its toll on all of us. Not slept in 2 days, and it shows. We stirred up a nest of some godsforsaken giant wasps, then came upon a squad of gobbos that turned into a fucking battalion. I was dead on my feet already so I threw myself at the nearest bunch, following Dodd’s lead. I didn’t account for my flank, and paid for it. </p>
      <p> When I came to, I was on Roughneck’s back, being carried back to town. The squad have taken to calling me Noddy, since I ‘sleep’ so much. The shame of it all is far more painful than the bumps and grazes - The squad don’t know it but names are really important to Goliath folk, and losing Treekeeper to be called Noddy… it feels like I’m going backwards. I keep letting the squad down. I need to prove I’m more than just a big oaf. Need to prove myself worthy. </p>

      <h2> Corwen's Journal #16 </h2>
      <p> Diary, </p>
      <p> We left Bessie with Lars. He seemed shifty when we mentioned the anvil but Roughneck reminded us we aren’t an adventuring group or a mystery-solving party, so we left it. Heading toward a bridge on the way to Ellensfort. </p>
      <p> Got given the lead to ensure a safe crossing, so I went up to the bridge - it was covered in some rank slime, with bits of material and horse gut just lying in it - and got the squad to flank me, checking beneath the bridge. The goo reacted to my touch, and so did the troll when it decided to rear up. I forget who took its head off but both Dodd and me had the idea of punting it into the river while Astrid, Peppercorn and Torch threw fire and swords into the body. a few of us took a lot of big hits, but Dodd turned medic and kept us from too much harm. </p>
      <p> The mood has shifted, I think, with the Sarge. He just watched us from the cart as we fought the troll. I never thought he’d shy away from battle, even if he thought we could handle it. But he just sat there, not a word or a hand to any of us. Maybe I misjudged him. </p>
      <p> Still, having the chance to lead the squad was a great feeling, and has eased my fears about losing face among the rankers. </p>
      <p> Anyway, we’re on the move now - picked up some guy from the Hundred Hounds, the mercenary group that protects kings rather than carts. Garvin was his name I think. Seems decent. A professional, to be sure. He’s going the same way as us up to Ellensfort so he’s on the cart with Roughneck now.  </p>

      <h2> Corwen's Journal #17 </h2>
      <p> Diary, </p>
      <p> There was a bandit encampment outside the fort, flying colours and sigils I didn’t recognize (Torch and Peppercorn said something about them representing the gods but I don’t go in for worship that requires buying banners and the like). But these bandits or whoever had trophies nailed to their makeshift battlements, trophies that got us all on edge. A Dwarf’s beard was flying like a pennant in the breeze, along with teeth and jaws and all manner of bodyparts from the wilds. Clearly, these folk are anti-nonhumans. Peppercorn was on edge, naturally, but I felt sick looking at these people and the harm they done. Killing for sport is bad enough, but killing for paranoia’s sake is pathetic. </p>
      <p> Anyway, Sarge saw the risk and gave Dodd the lead, so we marched on. Dodd said we were to keep our heads down, not engage even if provoked. It didn’t take long for that last bit to be tested, as a bunch of swiving cowards shouted at us to stop just as we made it near the fort’s walls. We didn’t, like Dodd said, and a crossbow bolt hit the cart a second later. Next thing we know, a dozen bolts are raining down and men with maces and axes are approaching. I asked Dodd if the plan was the same, he said yes, so we kept walking like we weren’t about to be swarmed like a slug over an anthill.  </p>
      <p> We couldn’t get to the fort gate without retaliating; these bandits meant to kill us. After a quick scrap we took a couple down and the rest fled. We kept the fallen scoundrels, thinking maybe Ellensfort would appreciate additions to their gaol or something. Dodd and Peppercorn checked their pockets and Dodd found a pouch of bone dice, only they weren’t bone, they were teeth. Goliath teeth.  </p>
      <p> Every time we get somewhere built up and settled, it’s filled to bursting with scum like this. I’ve travelled some and seen some measure of this world, and I reckon back home in Hillfog was the most respectable, well-mannered spot over all the rest. If Roughneck hadn’t snapped a few bits off those bandits I would’ve gladly sent them to whatever maker their banners represented.  </p>
      <p> Me and Peppercorn are waiting inside the fort’s walls now, guarding the cart as the rest of the squad heads up to meet the Baron (feeling pretty stupid for chucking the gobbos’ ears now, didn’t know this was where the Baron would be) Hannah, the captain of the guard here, thinks we might be in trouble for defending ourselves against those jerkinstains? I held my tongue at this. If the guard can’t keep travellers safe 20 feet from their front door, they need to change their names. </p>
      <p> Thinking of selling some of this gear we’ve gathered once Astrid, Dodd and Torch return, if Roughneck grants us leave. </p>

      <h2> Corwen's Journal #18 </h2>
      <p> Diary, </p>
      <p> Today, on the 26th of Emer, 1304 at around 2:45 am, Sergeant Thoralf Rasczak died in battle in the pursuit of his mission, and in the defence of his squad. We, the surviving members, grieve his loss and remember his words keenly as we lay his body to rest in the manner befitting a great and respected leader. </p>
      <p> After being debriefed by Dodd, Torch and Peppercorn as to the risk of staying in Ellensfort any longer than we had to, we had a talk on our options and chances of escaping what was fast becoming a hornets’ nest of political and religious zealots. From what Torch said, it sounded like a bunch of knights came down from the north, collecting the Silver Serpents up and forming something like an inquisition. With this army they’re investingating people and places - like the Baron in Ellensfort. When the team spoke with this Baron, it sounds like he was toying with shifting the suspicion of the knights onto us, after we bloodied their boys’ noses on the way in (in self defence, but when did that count for anything in ‘civilized’ society)  </p>
      <p> Torch and Dodd seemed to think this was a real time-sensitive issue, since the Baron might flip on us at any time and the knights were spoiling to punish us for the fight earlier, so we were thinking about ways to slip by. Torch sent her bird out to check the rear gate, but the Serpents were encamped on that side, too. Peppercorn had an idea - well, several ideas - to create distractions and draw the knights away from one exit so we could rush by in the commotion. Dodd and Astrid didn’t trust in the stupidity of the knights or the Serpents, which I guess was wise - the Serpents are known for being… well, slippery. I liked the idea of a distraction but didn’t want to go against Dodd, since he was still in command. After Peppercorn suggested using magic to float the cart, horses, crates and all away above our heads I kind of tuned out and began running through my own thoughts. </p>
      <p> I recalled Captain Hannah and how she was the closest thing we had to an ally here, so I piped up and suggested we ask if she knew another way out of Ellensfort. Torch seemed to like that, and said that I’m “not asleep on the job this time” which meant a lot. So Torch (being of noble stock and a powerful force in conversation) set out to seek Captain Hannah’s assistance. The outcome of this was a lead in the form of Rodney Threepiece, a smuggler and boat-owner. The plan was to make contact, make a deal, and make good our escape with his assistance. </p>
      <p> Astrid and I were sent to put the feelers out to Rodney at what was known to be his usual drinking hole, the Chain-Gang Bar. It was around 11pm on the 25th then, and we had no intention of staying the night, so we had to be less subtle than was comfortable. After I spoke with the barman and found Rodney, it became clear the request we had wasn’t that unusual for a bloke like him, so a deal was struck fairly quick - Our cart and horses, plus 50gp, for ownership of two rowboats out of Ellensfort. </p>
      <p> We didn’t sell the wine we were leaving behind - didn’t have the time to - and that seemed to annoy the squad, but we rowed fairly peacefully out of Ellensfort to the West, with Peppercorn’s disc storing what few extra provisions we coud manage, following the current with a view to happening upon shelter or a farmstead before turning North. I was in the front boat with some of the boxes, Astrid and Roughneck, with the others in the rear. That’s when were were attacked - in the dead of night, in darkness from beneath the water. </p>
      <p> I lost count of how many creatures surfaced. In the gloom and murk of the water it was hard to know when one of the beasts reared up and another sank down. They were human-like in size, but with scaled, slimy arms and razor fangs. A’times I thought some of them even had an extra set of arms as they lashed out against Dodd and Torch in the rear boat, though again that could have been the murk. I heard someone shout “Sahuagin!” but I don’t know if that’s a war cry or the name for these fuckers. Torch, in a burst of green light that scared the shit out of me and blew the guts out of two of the creatures, fired almost as soon as the first few beasts reared up, but the rear boat was quickly overrun and I could only fling a few desperate javelins from where I was at. </p>
      <p> The beasts teamed up to pull the boxes off of Peppercorn’s disc, and one of them grabbed her and tried to pull her off the boat itself. At this, Roughneck jumped headlong into the river, swimming against the current and in full gear to rescue her. Astrid quickly followed suit with a view to save Dodd, who was in danger of being dragged down too. All our fears were realised at once as the blue-green bastards joined together to topple the boat over, launching my comrades - and the cargo we were tasked with protecting - into the silt and darkness of the river.  </p>
      <p> I jumped over at this point, seeing Roughneck handling some beasts underwater and Dodd, clutching one of the precious boxes, being pulled under by claws, jaws and sharpened speartips. We didn’t know it but the river was deep as sin where we were, and these creatures could clearly manage fine underwater. I went after Dodd, thinking Roughneck could deal with a few fishmen on his own without issue. Luckily for all of us, Peppercorn, Astrid and Torch all were using all of their powers to destroy each and every one of our foes just as soon as they broke the water’s surface, so by the time I reached Dodd he just had corpses hanging off him. Some spell Peppercorn cast had lit up the boxes as they sank so I grabbed one as I swam to Dodd, pushing him and his box up to the surface. By the way he moved I could tell he was out, but I dared not entertain the idea he was gone.  </p>
      <p> When we both broke the surface the monsters had been dealt with, so I dragged my comrade and our cargo to shore. I got a face full of silty river water for my trouble, but Dodd spluttered back to life after some curative magic. Roughneck was on shore already, but he wasn’t moving. Astrid and Torch both used their powers of healing, but it was too late. We were too late. We were, and are, without a Sergeant. </p>
      <p> Dodd told us all to get his body aboard a boat and push it out to the middle of the river. Torch set it ablaze. We’re now waiting for Dodd to return - we decided, after a time, that one person needs to know what is in the crates we were told to guard with our lives. It was one of the bigger arguments our group has had. He’s been gone a fair few minutes now. Hope whatever it is was worth all this death and worry.  </p>
    </div>

    <div class="color3">
      <h2> Corwen's Journal #19 </h2>
      <p> Diary, </p>
      <p> Camped out a little ways away from the water now. The plan is to get some rest and make for the Dawn Hills on foot in the morning - if we don’t come across better transport before then. The Grunta Mines is our destination, it turns out (Dodd found a note on Sarge with the locale on it) so we’re hoofing it for as long as it takes to get up North. </p>
      <p> I’m worried about what could befall us before then, though. We never were told what happens if the commanding officer is killed in action. Truth be told I never thought it could happen, not to someone like Roughneck. Dodd’s in charge and we all (mostly) seem alright with it, but is that permanent? When we return to base, does he get promoted just because Roughneck died under his watch? That seems backward, and I don’t see the sense in it. Yet Dodd’s doing a good job of keeping us in line and it wasn’t him that told Roughneck to dive into the deeps and fight fishmen… But I can feel the rankers’ mood changing, hardening against Dodd with every order he puts through. Torch especially is poking at Dodd whenever she disagrees with a decision - at first I thought it was just how she is, but it seems more purposeful now - whether it’s an attempt to guide him into smart decisions or a move to coerce or undermine him, I can’t tell. It’s just a bit tense watching them talk. </p>
      <p> To go along with that, we’re all dealing with the fact we let Roughneck down. Any way you slice it, we failed, and he was pretty damn clear about how he <strike> sees </strike> saw failure.  </p>
      <p> But… is death failure? Like of course it’s a bad thing, but it’s also natural that a warrior dies in battle. It’s natural that they leave survivors to carry their name and legacy on into the future. maybe, in death, we complete our greatest challenges… I don’t know if I’m allowed to even think this sort of stuff, let alone bring it up with the squad. I daren’t mention it. </p>
      <p> Especially since… since I was the one who saw Roughneck go down. I saw how he was struggling with the fishmen all over him, and I also saw Dodd on the brink of death holding onto one of those godsforsaken crates. I made the choice without thinking in the murk down beneath the boat - it wasn’t even a thought, I knew Dodd needed saving and I thought I knew that Roughneck could save himself. I expected Roughneck to be behind me as I pulled Dodd to shore, berating Dodd for drowning saying something gruff to Peppercorn, but he wasn’t. He died because of the choice I made. And Dodd lived, because of the choice I made in his favour. So what does that mean? Did I fail in not saving both? or did I save the right man, knowing Dodd has yet to build his legacy and do his name proud? And does anyone even know I made that choice - do they suspect me, thinking I wanted the Sarge out of the way so I could advance in rank? Nobody has said anything but… Should I mention it? Do I carry this doubt with me alone? Dad always said a man needs worries like a ship needs ballast… But I’m a Treekeeper, not a sailor.  </p>
    </div>

    <div class="color1">
      <h2> Corwen's Journal #20 </h2>
      <p> Diary, </p>
      <p> Another breathless day of grunt work has found us in a shallow valley on the track east along the river, then north towards a wood that Torch’s bird found out. Looked like the tracks into the wood were well traveled, signifying a trade route and, hopefully, horses to lug these crates instead of me. </p>
      <p> So we took stock of our provisions first thing this morning, and found we have maybe - MAYBE - 5 days’ worth of rations left after the loss of our boats. After a truly depressing attempt at fishing (I never was good at it and it seems Peppercorn has never hunted in her confusingly long life) we made our way northward away from the river in the hopes that food would present itself to us. And, in a welcome turn of luck, that’s exactly what happened. </p>
      <p> Around 5pm we reach the crest of this little hill, below us in a sort of basin sat a herd of deer, just grazing away. Dodd and Peppercorn quickly organise a hunting sortie, with Peppercorn in the air and Dodd sneaking up on foot. The problem with sneaking up on wild animals is that they’re usually pretty good at seeing or smelling you, and the wind wasn’t in Dodd’s favour. just as they herd caught a whiff of him, Peppercorn let loose some magic bolts from the sky, dropping 3 deer while Dodd crossbowed another. The herd scattered but our haul was plenty - 4 deer between 5 people will last us 2 weeks, easy. I’ve finished butchering the carcasses now, just about to start tanning the skins once our camp is fully set up - we’re camping in this basin for the night, I’m on second watch I think. I’m not too worried about being in the basin since we’re in the middle of nowhere and away from any major tracks.  </p>

      <p> Should’ve been worried about our position. Somehow one of those fucking fishmen got to us in the night, lured us out with some kind of light that dazzled and paralysed those who got caught looking at it. Both me and Astrid get caught out, I take a pretty sound beating but we were all awake and swinging quick enough and took it to pieces in quick order.  </p>
      <p> The bastard fish had Roughneck’s dagger on it. Dodd’s holding onto it, but it boils my blood knowing these creatures took trinkets from their kill. Can’t help but feel some sort of kinship with the deer we let escape earlier… </p>

      <h2> Corwen's Journal #22 </h2>
      <p> Diary, </p>
      <p> We’ve made it to the wood. There’s a cabin there, but despite it being close to midday there’s no sign of life - no smoke, no noise, nothing. I volunteered to investigate but people are talking and debating about who knows what… I don’t think we even need to look inside the place - we’re not adventurers, remember? - but Dodd thinks we might learn something about the woods beyond if we check inside. So off I go. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="color1">
      <h2> Corwen's Journal #23 </h2>
      <p> Diary, </p>
      <p> I’m here grasping at words for feelings I never wanted to have again. I’ll start where I left off. </p>
      <p> I looked into the cabin at the outskirts of the woods like Dodd said and it was as I’d feared - corpses of the owners strewn about the floor (at least I think it was owners, there was enough guts for a full family) and a busted door that suggested an attack by a wild animal. We found big, heavy footprints about the place that looked catlike to me, but Peppercorn identified them as Displacer Beast tracks. Which is a big cat. So I was right. She said they’re nasty creatures with poison barbs on their tails so we were all on alert as we left the cabin and headed into the forest, on our trek to the Dawn hills. </p>
      <p> It was weird walking through this forest, seeing so much familiar tree and plantlife in an unfamiliar place that, to my shame, I found myself leading the squad astray. Dodd kindly suggested it may be fairy magic, since we found signs of fairy activity as we moved through the woods but I know in my gut that my lack of attention cost us time and energy. To prevent further delays i asked Torch to use Lionel as a sort of scout in the sky, as the bird can be above the canopy of the forest and navigate using the sun while we follow beneath. This proved effective, and we made good progress for the rest of the afternoon, finally coming to a spot well-suited for camping at around 10pm give or take. It was in the hollow of two fallen trees that we began our nightly routine of cooking, spreading our mats and organising watch. </p>
      <p> I took first watch, as I hoped to give the squad a rest from the extra walking I caused them. An hour or so into scanning the space beyond our campfire I found the murky yellow orbs of a wolf staring back, barely beyond leaping distance of my sleeping comrades. I froze, and thought hard about the consequences of sounding an alarm and striking down this animal. They rarely hunt alone, and the scent of any creature’s blood would draw more predators - and equally dangerous scavengers - into our encampment. So I stared the wolf down, forcing it to recognize me and realise I was unafraid. It soon got the message and left me to the remainder of my watch, and in my folly I silently thanked the animal for choosing to leave us unmolested. </p>
      <p> The rest of its pack made a different choice that night. </p>
      <p> I awoke about an hour before true dawn to a muffled scream and Torch yelling about an attack, and rolled over to my sword Canopy while flashes of magic fire lit up two of the… six? seven? A nightmare of wolves that had surrounded us with one of the beasts crunching down on Peppercorn, whose magic shield was the only thing keeping her from a certain and agonizing death… </p>
      <p> I split one beast’s gut as I leapt towards Peppercorn and her captor, but Dodd was there before me, putting himself in the way of the entire pack, wrestling with the wolf’s death grip as it tried to finish the fairy. He beat back the beast as Astrid and Torch assaulted the remaining creatures, and just as Peppercorn fell out of the braying mouth of the beast that thought to flee with her, Dodd scooped her up and held her against his chest, using his body as a shield. </p>
      <p> Torch ran up to the pack as it moved with the fleeing beast, seeing Dodd’s plan and, I assume, trusting as I had before with Roughneck that our leader had things under control, decided to attack the threats rather that protect and heal Dodd and Peppercorn. More firey death rained down on the beasts that remained but they seemed unphased, crazed by the blood Dodd had lost…  </p>
      <p> By the time Astrid, Torch and I made it over to Dodd, who was still holding Peppercorn… I couldn’t tell where his blood ended and Kazimir’s colours began. All was red, and the man I had come to know over these few weeks had departed the world. He left behind a broken body, a few blades, and a squad that had needed him far more than had valued him.  </p>
      <p> I am not ashamed to say I sobbed myself hoarse that day. On the 27th of Emer, 1304 we said goodbye to Dodd Welfer of Kazimir’s Own.  </p>
      <p> We have just decided to have Torch lead us until the Grunta mines, but by no means was it a clear victory. Peppercorn voted for Astrid, citing her calmness, solemnity and clear head as virtues befitting a leader. I agree, Astrid is a great and valued member of the squad, and I owe her my life more than most, but Torch is powerful, determined, to-the-point and refuses to court indecision or hesitation. These are qualities that lead a squad to victory in the face of loss and uncertainty. I admit, when Peppercorn suggested Torch was to blame for Dodd’s death I felt a tinge of guilt, as if my fallen comrade were watching and judging my decision as a betrayal, but it is not up to Torch, or any of us, to save the life of everyone. Astrid cannot be expected to heal every wound I take, nor can Peppercorn be expected to avoid every attack she faces. We rely on ourselves as much as each other, and we shoulder the burden of loss as a squad. Blaming one member of our group for the death of another is mistaking a friend for a foe - A pack of wolves killed Dodd, and a Sahuagin Warrior killed Roughneck. Torch is not to blame, and neither am I. </p>

      <h2> Corwen's Journal #24 </h2>
      <p> 28th Emer. </p>
      <p> Diary, </p>
      <p> The loss has yet to sink in, and I keep catching myself turning around when marching to check our formation and feeling panic as I count one member missing. Then I remember… Perhaps this is how every veteran feels after a few campaigns, scanning for faces long dead amid a quickly thinning battalion. </p>
      <p> Around noon we found tracks, small and goblinny, leading to a tree with a hole in it. We looked into it and there was a toy sword and shield hidden there. I was barely aware of this - keeping my mind on the path northeast was all I wanted. </p>
      <p> There was a fairly heated argument about leadership, and who came up with which idea as this ‘mystery of the tree hollow’ revealed itself to us and it felt so petty, so disrespectful, that I had to walk away. The body’s barely cold, by the gods… </p>
      <p> Another few hours of walking went by and we stumbled upon a cabin near a stream, in a fairly roughshod clearing. Torch announces our presence by stomping on a trap, catching her leg in the jaws of the thing. The owner of the cabin - Carrie Ironside, it turned out - was less than happy to see us to begin with, with bow drawn and a stern face to greet us, but we got to talking and she took pity on us and our loss. </p>
      <p> She told us a bit about her family - a husband who had left her and her young child, a family who had disowned her, a new start in the forest - and while she seemed cagey about this child, nothing about her threatened an ambush or dangerous lie (to me at least). She asked for help reseting the trap Torch had set off so I joined her, leaving the group by the house.  </p>
      <p> I hoped to understand better why she had left her home, in a city no less, to raise her child in the wilderness - I thought maybe she shared my disdain for civilisation as it is in those places - but I’ll never know now, as a few moments later Torch had let Lionel fly into Carrie’s cabin, no doubt to look for the child we had yet to see. Carrie let an arrow fly in response, pinning Lionel to the inner wall of her home. Carrie scolded the three shame-faced mercenaries by her home as I finished reseting her trap, feeling more weary than ever.  </p>
      <p> We lose friends almost as well as we fail to make them. </p>
      <p> We’ve set up camp further north, following Carrie’s parting words of advice as we left her clearing. More wolves were promised, and by Carrie’s reckoning we’ve only recently passed the centre of this forest. My bones ache from lugging these skins and crates and rations about, but we’ll be a few boxes lighter at the end of our journey at least. </p>

      <h2> Corwen's Journal #25 </h2>
      <p> Diary, </p>
      <p> We were raided in the night. Nobody saw what it was, if it were man or beast. My skins are ruined and our rations are all but gone. We found boot prints and Astrid made mention of Familiar something or other but I just don’t care now. I want done with this cursed box-ferry mission, I want a week to drink myself sodden and I want a pub boxing match to break a knuckle for Roughneck and Dodd’s memory. scrambling about for berries like a bunch of children out beyond their parents’ homesteads is not what I thought mercenary life would be.  </p>

      <h2> Corwen's Journal #26 </h2>
      <p> Diary, </p>
      <p> It truly is like the Elders say - “The Forest weeps briefly for one tree felled”. </p>
      <p> I was wrong to doubt the path we’re on. I mean that in the spiritual sense, not literally - I’m still not enjoying this forest’s tricky pathways - but we have defeated a foe with ease and made a fearsome friend all in one stroke! Dodd’s death - and the loss of our Sarge - still weighs heavy on us, but the world goes on and we carry their memories onwards. The forest weeps, but briefly.  </p>
      <p> After our camp was sullied in the night I could tell we were all feeling the heat of shame on our necks for letting an intruder get by us without raising an alarm, and the march north through the forest was made silently for the most part (Peppercorn’s insights and stories not included). The forest undergrowth got denser and denser the further in we travelled until, by aid of Lionel’s sight above the canopy, we reached what we thought was the centre of the forest, encased as it is in a dome of dense thorns. Torch let loose a fiery blast against the obstacle but no good came of it - either by magic or by dint of the plant’s nature, no path could be burnt into it. I’d never seen the like of it before, and nor had Peppercorn - she said perhaps the fairy folk of this forest were different to her kin elsewhere but it’d have to be a truly disturbed creature to create a barrier like this. </p>
      <p> As a flash of lightning, Lionel was struck from the sky and killed, causing Torch to reel back in a shared pain. She believes a bird - the bird that had haunted Astrid’s watch from before - had attacked. Whether by command or instinct, it was hard to say. Needless to say we all believed it was at the behest of a master that these beasts continued to stalk us - Displacer Beasts and birds of prey both.  </p>
      <p> To add to our troubles, a thick, waist-high bloom of mist had began roiling in from somewhere, hiding our footing and causing Torch to trip - on a carcass of a wolf, no less! We looked about to see what fiend or foe might have done such a thing and saw rising from the way behind us a plume of dark smoke, Which Astrid and Torch deemed to be from Carrie’s house. I left a prayer on the wind for her and her child - our passing-by was almost certainly the cause of those smoke clouds.  </p>
      <p> The wolf, Astrid decided, had been throttled to death, either by fearsome hands or a powerful jaw. as she let the wolf drop back to the ground it rolled - we were at the peak of a hill, and the bottom was some way down and away. As the body fell it parted the mist a bit, and revealed the ground where it lay - amid perhaps 2 dozen of its slain brethren. I shuddered to think of the creature that might attempt to dispatch a whole pack of grown wolves - let alone succeed in such an act! </p>
      <p> This was the strike that laid the oak - we needed to make distance away from whatever dread being was in command of these creatures, so we walked through the night to get around the dome of thorns and back headed north-east to the mines. </p>
      <p> By 1am on the 2nd of Aqua we were exhausted and weary, but determined not to let Dodd’s memory die in the forest that claimed his body. Peppercorn remarked that a stream was nearby, and flew with Lionel to get a closer look. they found, by the water’s edge, what they described as a greenskinned child with black hair and a bucket. (I believe this to be Carrie’s daughter, but that’s intuition’s whisper). </p>
      <p> I warned Peppercorn and the rest that perhaps the child is protected by the Displacer Beast, and that was why it was content playing in the water alone. Torch dismissed this and said we ought to go to the stream, so we do. </p>
      <p> Astrid lets out her well-worn “Well Met!” and not a handful of seconds later is greeted by a growl. the Displacer Beast attacked, not Astrid but the child herself, quickly silencing my worries of it being the child’s guardian. Almost as quick as the beast’s attack came a flame-sword wielding man, clad in dark maille and helmet, and with that sword he sought to undo the beast from tail to tonsils. </p>
      <p> We were unsure of his intentions at first, yet his blade struck true against a shared foe and I was unwilling to let the stranger face this beast alone. I ran up, just as Peppercorn and Torch let loose their magics - the beast dodged Torch’s flames but could not resist Peppercorn’s incantation that sought to melt the metal collar round its neck. The beast recoiled from this strange ally, whining in pain just as I picked up its front paws. I wanted to give the man a chance to regroup, and to vent my rage on a worthy enemy.  </p>
      <p> Torch’s usual firestorm was slowed by what she later recounted to be a woodblight, summoned by the noise from the forest depths. It made little difference though - with Astrid, Peppercorn and me all focusing on the beast we made short work of it, though the killing stroke was made by Red, the man with the flaming sword. I harvested the beast’s tail tentacles, more as a trophy than for any idea of selling or using it. </p>
      <p> Red told us of his travels through the forest once the beast’s odd limbs were off and the child was tended to. He seems to be a kind of monster bounty hunter - like us, he takes jobs in risky places against unknown threats. He told Astrid he owes her a life-debt for healing him while we fought - I missed that but it sounds like a very Astrid thing to have done. Also, Red said he knows where the Grunta mines are, and will help us find them. A boon companion in the making!  </p>
      <p> … I’m getting ahead of myself. In the hours after the fight we walk on and I ask Torch what she thinks of our new companion. “Keep an eye on him” she says. So I am.  </p>
      <p> Around 7am we hit upon a great rip in the earth, like the ground tore itself open. The bottom of this ravine was hidden from us, so its depth was unknown but it was clearly a fatal drop. With the child and Red’s great warhorse in tow we were never going to jump the gap, reaching 25 feet across in places. We decided to range along the edge of the chasm, walking away from the hedge dome and at a right-angle to our goal. After reminding Torch of Lionel’s usefulness in scouting the area we found that the chasm did eventually narrow, but that point was a few hours away. Without a better plan, we walked toward that narrow point. </p>
      <p> Around 2pm we reached the proposed crossing-point. I saw a tree nearby that, if felled carefully and with guidance, could act as a makeshift bridge for us all if we travelled single-file. With Red’s help and Peppercorn’s ever-valuable insight into how her friend (or was it relative? or mentor?) Fleetfoot McNowings once traversed a gap in a similar fashion, we had ourselves a fallen log spanning the space.  </p>
      <p> We passed over without any great issue, but once the last of us touched ground on the far side we heard a growl and the snapping of branches behind us. Our stalker had caught up with us, and revealed themself to be one of the Knights of the Pentagent (I think? Torch relayed this detail after the fight, such as it was, so I may be wrong). </p>
      <p> He was Tristan under the banner of Lyra, the god of Luck. a polished and noble-looking Paladin with a fearsome Displacer Beast and bird of prey in tow. Some words were exchanged between himself and Torch, which I missed entirely as I made signal to Red and readied my remaining strength to flip the log on which our foes stood. In a flash, the Displacer Beast leapt toward Red, as though guessing his intent. While he battled the creature I heaved with all my might against the log, but my strength was waning after two days’ marching without rest. In the end it didn’t matter, though. Peppercorn saw the Paladin approach and sent a whisp of magic energy toward his face which manifested as a swarm of insects before impact. The Paladin reeled, clearly caught off-guard by this surprising gambit. As he stumbled away from the gnawing, biting bugs and jerked his limbs to free them of the infestation, he moved a hair too far to the side of the log… and fell. Reacting quickly, like a trained acrobat the knight plunged a weapon into the log in a last-ditch attempt to save himself, but managed only to save the weapon from the fall as it was planted deep in the bark while its owner lost his grip, then his life.  </p>
      <p> Tristan’s second Displacer Beast was dispatched with ease after its master was gone, and the bird was nowhere to be seen afterward. Peppercorn, seeing the sparkle of the weapon went to retrieve it, but remembered that Red did not, as yet, know of her true form and so had to pretend she was unable to remove it. She did find and retrieve a coin though - it seemed as though Tristan had dropped it, too. Astrid held onto it for safekeeping. To aid Peppercorn (and to help her save face) I retrieved the sickle, and Torch said, since it may be magical and valuable, we should keep it out of sight until we find a worthy fence, or a reason to wield it. I agreed and gave the weapon to her.  </p>
      <p> I write this as we await the return of Red and Lionel, since they’re both out looking for the greenskin girl - Iona, daughter of the late Carrie Ironside - who ran off sometime after the battle. I had thrown the log into the ravine for good measure after the fight so she can’t have gone too far… though they’ve been gone a while… </p>
